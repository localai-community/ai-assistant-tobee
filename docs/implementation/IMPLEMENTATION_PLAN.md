# LocalAI Community - Implementation Plan

## Overview
A step-by-step plan to implement a local-first AI assistant with MCP and RAG capabilities. This plan focuses on simplicity and avoids over-engineering.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup

### Step 1.1: Project Structure
```bash
# Create basic directory structure
mkdir -p backend/app/{api,core,services,models,mcp}
mkdir -p backend/app/services/rag
mkdir -p backend/storage/{uploads,vector_db}
mkdir -p frontend
mkdir -p mcp-servers/{filesystem,code-execution}
```

### Step 1.2: Backend Foundation
- [ ] Create `backend/requirements.txt` with core dependencies:
  - FastAPI, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, alembic
  - httpx (for direct Ollama API calls)
  - langchain, chromadb, sentence-transformers
  - pymupdf, python-docx, unstructured
- [ ] Create `backend/Dockerfile`
- [ ] Create `backend/app/main.py` (basic FastAPI app)
- [ ] Create `backend/app/core/config.py` (settings management)

### Step 1.3: Frontend Foundation
- [ ] Create `frontend/requirements.txt` with Streamlit
- [ ] Create `frontend/Dockerfile`
- [ ] Create `frontend/app.py` (basic Streamlit app)
- [ ] Create `frontend/.streamlit/config.toml`

### Step 1.4: Docker Setup
- [ ] Update `docker-compose.yml` to use new structure
- [ ] Test basic container builds

## Phase 2: Core Chat Engine

### Step 2.1: Direct Ollama Integration
- [ ] Create `backend/app/services/chat.py`
  - Implement direct HTTP calls to Ollama API
  - Add streaming response handling
  - Add basic conversation management

### Step 2.2: Basic Frontend Chat
- [ ] Update `frontend/app.py` with Streamlit chat interface
- [ ] Connect to backend chat service
- [ ] Test basic conversation flow

### Step 2.3: Database Setup
- [ ] Create `backend/app/models/` with SQLAlchemy models
- [ ] Set up Alembic for migrations
- [ ] Create basic conversation and user models

## Phase 3: RAG System

### Step 3.1: Document Processing
- [ ] Create `backend/app/services/rag/document_processor.py`
  - PDF processing with PyMuPDF
  - DOCX processing with python-docx
  - Text chunking and splitting

### Step 3.2: Vector Database
- [ ] Create `backend/app/services/rag/vector_store.py`
  - ChromaDB integration
  - Document embedding and storage
  - Basic similarity search

### Step 3.3: RAG Integration
- [ ] Create `backend/app/services/rag/retriever.py`
  - LangChain integration for RAG chains
  - Hybrid approach: direct API + LangChain
- [ ] Update chat service to use RAG when documents available

### Step 3.4: File Upload
- [ ] Add file upload endpoint to backend
- [ ] Update frontend to handle file uploads
- [ ] Connect upload to document processing pipeline

## Phase 4: MCP Integration

### Step 4.1: Basic MCP Server
- [ ] Create `mcp-servers/filesystem/` with basic file operations
- [ ] Create `mcp-servers/code-execution/` with safe code execution
- [ ] Update `mcp-config-local.json` with new servers

### Step 4.2: MCP Backend Integration
- [ ] Create `backend/app/mcp/` integration layer
- [ ] Connect MCP servers to chat engine
- [ ] Add tool calling capabilities

### Step 4.3: Frontend MCP Support
- [ ] Update Streamlit frontend to display tool results
- [ ] Add action buttons for MCP tools
- [ ] Handle tool execution status

## Phase 5: Polish & Testing

### Step 5.1: Error Handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Add logging throughout the application
- [ ] Add health check endpoints

### Step 5.2: User Experience
- [ ] Add loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Improve chat UI with better formatting
- [ ] Add conversation history persistence

### Step 5.3: Testing
- [ ] Test local-only deployment
- [ ] Test document upload and processing
- [ ] Test MCP tool execution
- [ ] Test offline functionality

## Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment

### Step 6.1: Documentation
- [ ] Update README with new setup instructions
- [ ] Create user guide for features
- [ ] Document API endpoints

### Step 6.2: Production Readiness
- [ ] Add environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Optimize Docker images
- [ ] Add monitoring and health checks

### Step 6.3: Final Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing of all features
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security review

## Implementation Principles

### Keep It Simple
- Start with basic functionality, add complexity gradually
- Use proven, stable libraries
- Avoid premature optimization

### Local-First
- Every feature should work offline
- No external API dependencies for core functionality
- All data stays local

### Modular Design
- Clear separation between components
- Easy to test individual parts
- Simple to extend and modify

### User-Centric
- Focus on user experience
- Clear error messages
- Intuitive interface

## Success Criteria

- [ ] AI assistant runs completely offline
- [ ] Document upload and RAG analysis works
- [ ] MCP tools execute successfully
- [ ] All components are containerized
- [ ] Documentation is complete and clear
- [ ] Code is well-structured and maintainable

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Ollama compatibility**: Test with multiple model versions
- **Memory usage**: Monitor and optimize for large documents
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize bottlenecks

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to core features, defer nice-to-haves
- **Dependency issues**: Use stable, well-maintained libraries
- **Integration complexity**: Test components individually first

## Next Steps After MVP

1. **Advanced RAG**: Multi-modal documents, better chunking
2. **More MCP Tools**: Web search, database operations
3. **User Management**: Authentication, user sessions
4. **Advanced UI**: Custom components, themes
5. **Performance**: Caching, optimization
6. **Deployment**: Kubernetes, cloud deployment options

**Remember**: This is a local-first, privacy-focused AI assistant. Every decision should prioritize user control and data sovereignty.
